#version 440

// Digital rain for the matrix theme.
//
// Started from bjarneo/quickshell's `matrix.frag` (MIT,
// https://github.com/bjarneo/quickshell): the cell structure, the per-column
// offset hashed from the id and the scanlines all come from there.
//
// Changed from the original: that one drew procedural 3x5 pixel blocks. Here an
// atlas of the real halfwidth katakana is sampled instead -- exactly the ones
// `ttfx matrix --rain-symbols` uses, the effect behind Omarchy's screensaver.
// The colours are its own too (--highlight-color and --rain-color-gradient),
// and the head goes at the BOTTOM, which is where ttfx puts it ("color for the
// bottom of the rain column").

    // The speed is quantised so that k whole cycles fit into exactly `period`
    // seconds. That is the entire trick behind wrapping the clock invisibly:
    // every column is periodic with `period`, so the wrap changes nothing.
    // A cycle therefore lasts period/k, whatever the screen is: `speed` scales
    // with `span`, so the two cancel.
    //
    // The unavoidable consequence is that the WHOLE FIELD repeats every
    // `period`, and there is no way round it in a shader with no state: a rain
    // that never repeats needs speeds that are not commensurate, and those give
    // the clock nowhere to wrap. So the repeat is pushed out of sight instead.
    // `k` and `period` scale together -- speed is k*span/period and a cycle is
    // period/k, so multiplying both by 30 leaves the rain looking identical and
    // only moves the repeat from every 2 minutes to every hour. It also buys
    // 601 distinct speeds instead of 21, and lets mod(cycle, k) run through
    // hundreds of variants of a column before it comes back round.
    //
    // An hour is where this stops, not where it stops being nice: `travel` is
    // computed in float32, and at period 3600 its quantum is 0.017 of a row.
    // Doubling the period doubles that, and the fall eventually judders.

    // Every cycle length divides `period` exactly, so any clustering of these
    // offsets does not wash out: it comes back, in full, at every wrap.
    //
    // Written down because it shipped wrong. This used to be the cold start's
    // stagger, which put every column within 2.2 s of every other, and the
    // whole field then re-aligned every `period` -- the screen emptied almost
    // to black and a single wave fell from the top again. Measured on a 20 s
    // build: brightness 0.01506 at t=3.5 and 0.01507 at t=23.5, 0.00023 at

    // quarter off everything -- and with one cycle in five now resting, the
    // whole thing came out 40% darker than the version this is an edit of.

    // column waits until it BEGINS a cycle, so it enters over the top edge
    // instead of appearing halfway down. Because the offsets above are spread
    // across a whole cycle, so is this wait -- which is what fills the screen
    // gradually instead of in one wave, and costs nothing in synchrony.
    //
    // Measured against `birth` and never against iTime. `birth` counts from the
    // moment the surface appeared and QML caps it past the longest possible
